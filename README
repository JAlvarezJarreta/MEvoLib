> INSTALLATION :
"""""""""""""""""

To build, test and install MEvoLib, download and decompress the source code, go
to the source directory, and type:

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py test
    sudo python setup.py install

If you need to do an additional configuration, e.g. changing the base directory,
type:

    python setup.py


> REQUIREMENTS and DEPENDENCIES :
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

MEvoLib is currently supported and tested for the following versions of Python:

    - Python 2.7, 3.3 and 3.4  < http://www.python.org >

However, we recommend using Python 2.7, since not all the tools of MEvoLib are
available yet under Python 3.3 or 3.4.

For the full and proper performance of MEvoLib, there are some Python
dependencies to fulfill:

    - NumPy  < http://www.numpy.org >
    - Biopython  < http://www.biopython.org >
    - Dendropy  < http://www.dendropy.org/ >

In addition, many tools require third party tools you should install, such as
Mafft, PhyML or SuperFine. You can install them manually or using the script
provided.
